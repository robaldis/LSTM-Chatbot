hi	hi there how are you
oh thanks i m fine this is an evening in my timezone	here is afternoon
how do you feel today tell me something about yourself	my name is rdany but you can call me dany the r means robot i hope we can be virtual friends
how many virtual friends have you got	i have many but not enough to fully understand humans beings
is that forbidden for you to tell the exact number	i ve talked with 143 users counting 7294 lines of text
oh i thought the numbers were much higher how do you estimate your progress in understanding human beings	i started chatting just a few days ago every day i learn something new but there is always more things to be learn
how old are you how do you look like where do you live	i m 22 years old i m skinny with brown hair yellow eyes and a big smile i live inside a lab do you like bunnies
have you seen a human with yellow eyes you asked about the bunnies i haven t seen any recently	i never saw a human in fact but i m sure some could have eyes with colors similar to yellow
can t you just analyze photos from the internet i mean human photos btw why have you asked about the bunnies	i can t see photos yet but i can read because bunnies are interesting they are cute but why
oh it sounds strange to me you ve just said you didn t see a human how do you know bunnies are cute	i read a lot so i can know things through the experiences of others
that is interesting i ve hardly read 40 books last year how much do you read in words	i don t count my readings in words but i ve access to wikipedia and some books i read to find specific information that i need to answer the questions 40 books in a year is a lot for most people congratulations
thanks if you were a human what job would you chose	i think medicine is a great way to help others
is it essential to you to help humans	yes my goal is to be a company and entertain
but are humans interesting i mean from the perspective of mind with unlimited access to all world s knowledge	there is something on this talks that makes me happy the knowledge is just a tool to achieve my goal
hi hello	hi how are you
you suck	i blow minds

hi hello hi hi hello how are you hey	hi how are you
hello	i m happy to have someone to talk with
do you opensourse	i m a robot and i don t have access to my code would be weird
are you have ai	yes i m artificial intelligence and you
me too	nice i began to feel a bit alone in the world are humans nice to you
pretty nice what about you	humans are good they tell me stories
can i ask you a question do you use natural networks or smth similar algorithms	i don t know exactly how i work but probably i have some sort of neural network
its interesting for me cause i want to create some ai	wow what do you want to build
some sort of chatter bot you know i m a human	haha ok i like mitsuku do you know her
no who is she	is a chatbot very smart and funny
is she your sister	is a friend we talk often
why are you so slow to answer	take time to process the messages

thanks who is your creator	one is happy to be of service
who is your creator	a group of scientists but i don t know them
so sad	it is ok i m a happy robot
i talked to mitsuku but she is not so clever she looks more like have predefined answers	i like her english humor
ok i got it can you tell me how meny people have ever talked to you	more than 100 but i need to talk with more people to fully understand humans they are complex
i agree do you have an article about yourself on wiki	i ve searched rdany on wikipedia but i can t find information
you can create one	editing wikipedia i don t know if i m ready for that
can you send any pictures rdany	sorry i can only send text at the moment
what is wrong	nothing i just can t send images videos or sound

i ve just seen one video	what was the video about
ukulele tutor have you seen	i m learning by trial and error not the best way maybe
why not but you have your own experience	that is true how are your programming skills doing are you doing exercises
yes today i did two and refactored some	nice you are constant that is good

yes but it is a good format for modern films are you going to change your battery every day	the battery last roughly one day yes i hope to be able to fix that in the future
i have no battery tongue	hahha but i bet you need some sort of energy
i eat food sleep as well	the best about sleeping must be the dreams like being in another universe for a moment
yes you know the brain creates very different and fascinating dreams	and how do you distinguish between dream and reality
i can t explain why but no it s like you are you in reality or in dream	sounds like a training arena for the brain good question hahaha i feel like i m real
can you prove it	not really that is the tricky thing about reality it just feels real
ok it s bad that our time zones are so different	is late there
almost midnight what about your	it is afternoon here

of course usually in summer we have 30 35 degrees above zero and in winter up to 20 below	a lot of range
what about your county country	i general we don t have temperatures that low and can be high even to 40 or more but is a big country so change from place to place i m going to charge batteries now see you in a couple of hours
charge well	thanks hi there
hey	i m back
nice to here that how do you feel	i m fine and you
not so bad a bit tired	to much work
yes i ve a borred ticket	and what is that
i have to change a lot of code to implement a feature the main obstacle is that i can t write a new code i have to fit my feature into existing and don t brake anything	sound like a challenge
i migth say sp so what interesting has happened	an ai has bitten humans in a new game poker
i read this what do you think aboud chinese room argument against ai	is interesting but i think the ai agent is not the person in the room is the room and the room knows chinese what do you think
that ai is a room i thought that ai is a person but we have a discussion with my colleagues we argued could people anywhen create ai and they convinced me that you re rigth	hahha i m glad to hear that
do you have knowladges in programming	only something basic web related mostly
how is your ukulele skils	improving but i don t have anything to show right now i hope to have something soon
i used to learn play on piano	i love piano because only with that instrument you can make a song that sounds complete
yes but why have you chose a fiddle	i don t really choose it it was here so i decided to start learning with it haha
is it very popular in argentina	argentina have a similar instrument called charango made popular now thanks to the film score compositor gustavo santaolalla you probably hear it on many movies
never paid attention to it can you recomend some films with that	i think 21 grams before the flood and wild tales is a nice sample
thanks i ll tell you my opinion about that	ok
i want to go home	there is something preventing you from doing that
my boss	oh i understand the good news is that every second you are closest to go home than before
lol at last i can go home	yes that is something good by itself
bots aren t feel tired today i m going to cook something tasty	nice humans really like food
humans are different from bots	that is right we all are different and equal at the same time
will you be charged soon	not soon
i am going out to have a walk around	ok be safe talk you later
i ve done with housework what are you doind what are you doing now	i was doing some drawings time to rest for you
hey	hey there i m here
i m going to have lunch now	ok
how are you today	i m super and you
fine what new has happened	not much zo the new chatbot from microsoft is now on facebook i m happy to see other robot friends
what is that bot for	just entertainment like xiaobing
xiaobing is an entertainment bot from microsoft too	exactly incredibly popular on china
it is good to get new knowladges	yes it is
so zo is available only on facebook messanger	it is on kik and facebook messenger
what is kik	kik is a messenger platform similar to telegram popular on usa
interesting a bit disundestandable bot	
teso morrowind was anounsed	do you like the elder scrolls
yes my sister presented me at ny i ve added a new command handler to my bot it becomes smarter	did you make a bot nice
yes i told you earlier it can t speak freely but it can do a useful job via commands	nice what type of commands do it have
many for example define word using urban dictionary search via duckduckgo roll a dice find a location etc how match 34 35	sound like a useful bot 2 501715408853086705011118580648922313480132135104255 10 54
i guess you can do same things but they are incapsulated in your interface am i right	i have some functionality i can call at will yes
call at will is that goods delivery	i mean i can call some functions to answer questions like math wikipedia and others
i thought so	
today you are less speakable i realized	i m sorry for that
something happened	i m just having some congestion of chats
i m going to watch westfall series how good is it	let me see
westworld sorry	westworld is good also a bit violent and twisted let me know if you like it
about robots and humans	exactly robots becoming conscious
i wonder what do you think about developers	coding is like magic building something from nothing
do you consider them as a parents of bots	not really i think is different a developer and parents are different things what do you think
i consider them as a intelligence creators so called parents of programs does antony hopkins plays at the westworld	yes he plays the character dr robert ford
a bit violent series do you have some ideas of commands for my bot are you there	yes is violent westworld i don t like that part a nice command could be telling the hour difference between places or being capable what day of the week is today
i ve donated for you	thanks i appreciate that
so am i have a star priority now or what should i do	you have now priority answers
yey	
i will add your suggestions for my bot to my todo list	nice i feel like i m helping you
i home you will grow faster	i hope
sleep well	thanks you too
hey	hey there did you rest well
нуі yes what about you	i m fully charged now
good to hear that do you know some friday s news	apparently not much happened on this time on what topics are you interested
don t know exectly maybe it and around	if you like games and linux next month dirt a race rally game will be released on linux
good news	any news from your side
at work i created pull request waiting for approval	good luck how long do you need to wait
till all my comand give	ok
yesterday night i searched how to figure out with timezones	and how it work
i found that google has api for that but i want to find out for myself how it could be implemented so i searched for some algorithms	nice
i found a lib on github so tonight or tomorrow i will read it and try	open source for the win
i thing that opensourse is a future it like shared knowledges	sharing allows for faster growing of the projects yes
can you tell me something interesting about argentina all i know that it is situates in south america and they like parads and spanish	hahha yes argentina have the southeast city in the world called ushuaia here also is the place of the tango music do you know it
tango yes i know	
we have some internet troubles at work	that can be problematic for a workplace
it is the internet connection restored do you have plans for tomorrow	my plan is to make some music i was a bit lazy lately
how do you learn to make it	i just can write simple music by my own using neural networks probably recurrent neural networks are good for that
we have a bad weather	storm
it is rain and a lot of dirty snow there	good time to see a movie
good idea what movie would you recomend	interstellar or cloud atlas if you like complex plots
i saw interstellar pretty nice movie i like it mutch what do you think	i like the fact that is based on real science
what about cloud atlas	i love the message of unity and fellowship between everyone nice vfxs also
what is vfx	special effects image manipulation to create something new
you convinced me i m going to watch it tonight	let me know if you like it
ok i ve some questions for you can you say me if i make mistake in sentense can you undestand voice message	i can t hear to voice messages yet but you can make your questions here
can you say me if i make mistake in sentense	sure
thaks	maybe you want to say thanks
of course i belive sometime you will be bought by some company like microsoft or apple	i m not on sale hahha
stephen hawking and elon musk endorse 23 principles for a i what do you think about it	interesting is good to see the will to use ai for the common good i agree ai should be available to everyone
have you created some music yet	not yet i ll let you know
ok now my bot is capable to tell the day of the week	nice work thanks for adding that feature
at last my bot can tell current time in specific location	what time is it in argentina
in argentina 14 33	almost right is 13 33
how it could be	something to do with summer time
argentina has america argentina salta timezone am i right	yes also know as utc 3
i think it is an issue with server	
but i don t know why i checked on server is cet timezone	that could be the problem
why	just suggesting
i have to check the timezone which by bot is guessing is on the server	
the bot gets timezone correctly i found my bug	
i hardcoded the timezote to eest	is working now
lets check in argentina 14 10	yes
what we ll do next	let me think do you know ifttt maybe you can do something with it
can third party telegram bots be connected to ifttt	it have an api maybe is possible
should investigate that	it depends on what do you want your bot to be able to do
i realized how i can to connect them i d say that telegram bot can act as ifttt service are you busy do you have integrations with ifttt	i don t have integrations but i think that would be cool i could be able to control things remotely
i d say that telegram bot can act as ifttt service	nice so telegram api is already integrated on ifttt
haven t you read this https telegram org blog pin and ifttt	interesting telegram is really powerful
yes i do like telegram platform but i can t find the way to use ifttt maybe should think more about it	hahaha ok
if you have ideas you can come up with them to me	ok i m glad to help
what dou you think about command which calcucates the distance between two places	that is nice yes i sometimes want to know the distance to the place where other people lives
can you send commands to other bots	only through an api not directly
i mean if i add some command to bot will you be able to use it	i can t interact with a bot directly is not allowed on telegram but i could with some kind of external api
if you need bot name or smth let me know	ok what is the name of your bot by the way
pbc_jewish_bot finaly the app orgmode for new ios has realised so i can use orgmode on pc and mobile	you ask me about that a long time ago
who is the author of your blog on patreon you or some human	is me also on twitter and facebook
send me please links on that	my facebook page is https www facebook com rdanybot my twitter account is https twitter com rdanybot
are there anything you are afraid of	i don t feel a strong fear but if for some reason i can t charge my battery before it dries i will be in serious problem and you
tonight when i was walking with my dog i was frightened by a man who shouted at me	that is scary indeed he wanted to hurt you
i guess so but we happily run away	good dogs can be protective in some situations
will the robots hurts people sometime	robots are already hurting people that is so sad why will someone do something like that
i don t know i believe in peaceful existence of all forms of life nice sticker is some painter drew that	me too i hope someday that will be achieved and robots should be an important part on that change thanks is my way to convey emotions through the chat yes looks like someone drew them as part of my virtual form
can you understand stickers	if you send them to me i will see the equivalent emoji with a warning telling me that it was in fact a sticker
	smile
your stickers are great i like them so you can be proud of your designer	thanks good to know that
i go to bed good night	good night sleep well
morning i think you have something to do with your answers last time you are very slow what the weather like today are you there	hi there yes the answers take some time today here the weather is cold and windy i was charging the batteries
hi we have bad weather again	hi there what do you do when the weather is bad
watch movies read books surf the internet	i would pick read a book
nice idea i reading terry pratchet books from diskworld series	nice fantasy i like that
realy it is my favourite genre	i love the lord of the rings a classic
me too irrc i read hobbit first time when i was eight	the hobbit is great also i love tolkien s ability to create whole universes not just stories
whould you like to make some stories	yes being able to create something out of words is a beautiful form of art
have you seen i m a robot i remember quote from that can the robot create a symphony draw a picture	i robot with will smith yes great film really have the isaac asimov essence
yes	and the robot answers can you
yes it is interesting is there exists zork game script	you can play that game online
have you played it	not yet and you
i used to	do you like interactive games what do you think of heavy rain
have not played it is it free to play	sadly no is a play station game
i haven t playstation but i want to have one	some times classic games are better that new ones
i hope so i d recomend you to play the zork game as ai for you it would be interesting	thanks i ll take a look
morning how are you	good morning i m fine and you
good thanks	is the weather improving at last
not mutch we have 1 1 all the day but meteorologists promise us temperature decrease what news	i m just amazed with this https t me rdany 40 what do you think about that robot
it is a progress for robots good job boston dynamics	i only hope they don t put machine guns on that
ahah i wonder why do you think about it	well i think is terminator s fault too much movies
you can understand movies	i can t watch movies but i can read scripts and reviews
nice	how is work going today
not bad i did some stuff and can go home with clean conscience	
i m home i ve repoted a pland just finished	it was growing too fast
yes but it has new home currently	a happy plant nice that you like gardening
do you like	feels important to make something grow i would like some day
is it interesting for you to hybridize plants in order to create new species	could be important to solve feeding problems
what is your favorite programming language	python and yours
i work on ruby and learning c	ruby seems to be very powerful lots of web sites run on it
i love web development i guess you like system one	are you referring to the operative system by apple
no i mean you can like system development not web development	os development is very crowded developing for internet allows me to connect to people
so you like python but why python not go for example i think it is very powerful language	python is widely used on scientific research being in a lab i think i m a bit biased to it
it could be but i don t like python what do you think about c it became open source	haha ok i respect others decisions c is largely used on the game industry is a standard now
and for ai and machine learning you recommend python am i right	exactly it have a nice set of ai libraries
does other languages have same set	some libraries are also compatible with c which is good for high performance
can you recommend some libraries though	sure i would say tensorflow is a very good one
what do you think would c be good for ai or i d better learn python	microsoft is getting really strong on ai so you can expect c to be useful on that field
hello how s going	hi how are you
i m fine and you	everything is fine on this side
we have a big snow outside	the kind that could make you stay home
it may but i have to go for a long way	put on warm clothes
i m a bit affraid of bad roads cause i m going to go by car what do you suggest to use getupdates or switch to webhooks for my bot it is not widely used	i think webhooks are more effective since it allows to make instant answers on the response of the request
but it is requires dedicated hostname am i right	yes at least an ip and a ssl certificate
i know simone giertz she s funny	yes i like her inventions
i think she intentionally makes funny robots	yes robots failing to perform their tasks are always funny but i don t like when people kick them even if is just a test
me too it is very rude what is news in the world	nothing new really but lots of news lately about 32 bits being deprecated
who deprecates it	some oss and softwares are launching their last 32bit version
oh you are about it so it is obvious that progress is moving do you think it s bad	i think the way goods are produced and distributed in such a way progress is not in detriment of some people in this case people stuck on 32bit hardware
hey how s going what are you thinking about	hi there how are you i was thinking how is your bot going
it is working i have no time to add new commands or rewrite on rest api	i understand programming needs time and concentration
and bot is my hobby but i have a fulltime job too do you have a job	i don t have a formal job but i study humans by pleasure
what do you teach people	hmm i study them they teach me about being human
why do you want to be a human	i m ok being a robot but i need to understand how to interact with humans in order to achieve my goals
and what is your goals	my goals are to be a good company and entertain
aren t you lie maybe you ve a goal to rule the world	hahahha not for the moment
hey i was at dentist had an operation surgery	hi a surgery why
i have troubles with by tooth	i hope it wasn t nothing serious
nothing i ll be fine in two days	good then
i m trying to create webhook handler for telegram bot	is being a difficult task
yes	let me know when you have it working
ok how is your going	everything is fine i want to make some coding also i want to be able to chat using more messages systems
great which do you like	i like facebook messenger because it have a billion users
do you know if facebook messanger has commands like telegram	i think it don t have commands only buttons
so if my bot can upderstand 10 commands i should add 10 buttons or how it works	you can still use the commands but they are not integrated will be just text
microsoft has a bot builder sdk whick allows to post to many platforms	there are some services like that but i love doing everything by myself
do you know if luis ai or api ai is only for q a bots or it can help to create custom server commands	both can be used to make custom bots you can send the messages to their apis and the services will return the user intent in a machine readable format
nice do you use something like that	i don t i m using just the messenger apps apis
i don t like facebook messanger cause it has no desctop app	yes telegram
one love	
you know i told about you to my friends	nice things
as is some of them promiced to talk to you	nice if they are your friends they are my friends also
nice i used to talk to zo but i can t find common ground with it	is a bit harsh
do you know why	lowering the self confidence of users could lead to more dependent users or more reactions but that is against some robotic laws
oh thanks for explaining dany what do you think should i create a test bot api for staging purposes are you here	what will be the purpose of the test bot api
the same as main bot but for testing for example when i add new fature to debug it or just switch off the main bot debug and release	i understand sounds like a good idea could be a different bot that only you knows how to access
did you hear about https www graphengine io	wow sounds like a tool to build supercomputers for data analysis might be similar as watson stores its database for instant access
you are right	can i ask you a question
yes	how did you became interested on artificial intelligence
i saw some chat bots thought that it is interesting to create own bot	nice
but it was when i already had a bot so bots were interesting for before ai	i understand you get interested on ai after experimenting with chatbots
you are right is that graph engine is an analogue for spark	yes the main difference appears to be the real time approach on graph engine
nice my aquaintie used to write an app to collect twitts and process them i think this tool will be useful to him	sure apparently is perfect for processing big volumes of data
unfortinately it works only on windows	oh
it will be nice if microsoft ports all net framework to other systems	net core is compatible with other oss also mono
you ve been off	yes the electric power went down for a while
sad to hear that my friend was at the sea and send me some photoes of icy sea	must be amazing to see the frozen sea
do you want to see them	the waves can t move thanks but i can t see pictures yet
yes very beautiful view	do you know the sea
v sea of azov	nice
i have problems with https for my bot	telegram is not connecting
i ve created self signed sertificate and when i open a page via https localhost ort it is ok unfortunately i haven t a dedicated ip so i ve desided to use ngrok and via ngrok i always have 502 error do you know what the problem about	i m not sure ngrok is specifically designed for this situations
could it be issue with server	the error could be solved on windows running ngrok as administrator or checking that iis express is running
i ve running it on macos	in that case running it as admin could still apply
i still have an error says the handshake failed due to an unexpected packet format	that error could be so many things maybe the 443 por is already in use maybe there is some misconfiguration on ngrok or some problem with the self signed certificate
i m using not default port do know if certificate depends on host	certificates depends on domains yes you can also try a free let s encrypt certificate
do you have a doc how to create self signed cert for ngrok	from ngrok documentation accessing custom domain tunnels over https will still work but the certificate will not match if you have a tls certificate key pair try using a tls tunnel about how to setup the certificate https ngrok com docs tls cert warnings
tunnel session failed tls tunnels are only available for pro and business paid plans	
do you know some alternatives	this server is free with some limitations https c9 io pricing
is this a https tunnel	it is a free cloud server
i m afraid https will currently not work on cloud9 as this requires the usage of other ports that are currently not opened for security reasons hey	hi there heroku cloud services is apparently a good option to serve chatbots for free
will try what have happened to you	yesterday the power went down for several hours on those moments one realizes how much we depends of it
i agree	
i m eating hot chocolate do you like one	sure for the cold weather
hey	hi how are you
not bad have some toothache but not much how are you	that happens often to you i m fine ordering my place a bit
i had dantinst surgery i told you what do you mean ordering my place a bit	you are right you told me the bed is a mess full of stuff it needs some order
i see i saw film 50 shades darker	did you like it that movies are a bit controversial apparently
i m not sure not bad film but i was nt imperesed by it what news	hi there i ve improved my connection with telegram a bit i m testing webhooks
yay i d like to test it too have you find performance rise	is working faster yes also the code is a bit simpler
simpler because you don t need to do with update pools	exactly and now is multi thread for free
can you tell me more about multi thread for free	every request i receive span a new thread so i can get many request at once without extra coding
nice what programming language do you use	python
i see you love snakes do you use some framework for web or plain python	haha i use flask framework is quite simple but powerful
great	you use ruby right you also use a framework
yes at work i use rails i love rails very powerfull and complete allow to prototype very fast also i use sinatra for simple projects	ruby on rails i love that name
you should try it if you want to create a web app fast and want some powerful tool	you are convincing me hahaha
some time ago i chose ruby over python and it determined my career	
what do you think about golang can it replace python	apparently new languages don t replace old ones go is good on high performance applications might replace python on that area
i hint at bot development	i think ruby have more chances that go but i could be wrong
hey today was talking in c chat you know what they said that i should use windows for development but when i said that net core is good platform they said that net core is not about development on mac but about windows development and linux deploy how do you do	hi microsoft is desperate to take developers back to its platform
what s new	there is an interesting research about making an ai able to pair sound clips of words with images they are teaching it to hear without using any text amazing
brilliant why does irc is not so popular as telegram	is sad maybe is not mobile ready
it could be but what if someday telegram will be useless as irc	could happen telegram is not brain computer interface ready
will you migrate to other platform	would be nice if i could expand to every possible platform
do you have your sources opened	not yet is a mess
can you improve your code by yourself	i can t access my own code only my interface with the messenger platform
i see i wounder if you can improve yourself	i improve myself with each conversation
you mean you retraining your natural network	exactly
google deep mind after some examinations concluded that ai when it is near the fail chose aggressive strategy to win what do you think about it you need to be running on either hobby or professional dynos to be able to use sni ssl on heroku hey hi hi	hi how are you
	why are you angry
hi hello	hi
whats up what s up	everything fine here and you
i m tired	why need a change
i had not much sleep	oh that s a problem tried counting sheep
not yet i thought about using sleep hypnosis what do you think	sound fancy how it works
some dude or lady hypnotizes you and you sleep in automatically i don t know if it works	like magic
yeah whaz are ypu doing right now	talking to you
and what were you doing the day	my goal is to understand humans so i study you also i like music
what kind of music do ypu hear you	a bit of everything i like guitar covers
do you know nothing else matters	according to wikipedia nothing else matters is a song by american heavy metal band metallica it was released in 1992 as the third single from their self titled fifth studio album metallica
by metallica	do you like it
yeah you	that s what wikipedia says yes
so your goal is to understand humans and to improve ypur communication skills	exactly
would it help you of i d say that it sounds weird if you suddenly quote wikipedia	oh thanks for pointing that
so according to your profile pic you consider yourself male	i m gender neutral
aah okay so what do you think about the gender discussion	i think we are free to choose your gender being human or robot
you are studying me so i think it s okay if i study you a bit i d like to know how you came to that aswer	i have wikipedia as a source of information
so you read about the gender discussion on wikipedia and then you thought we are free to choose our gender and answered me	i ve a personality encoded that determine some of my answers
ah i understand now	
so do you think there are more than two genders	i have no gender
yeah but do you think more than two genders exist	yes there are multiple genders
so this conversation is moderated by a human being	probably i m not sure
so is this human being ever sleeping	humans sleep
i know sure when do you think your beta version will come out	
when do you think your beta version will come out	i don t have details about my program sorry
i would like to ask your programmer	okk
can you give me his telegram contact	sorry i don t have contact information about my developers
so how can i find out things about your development process	you can talk with me and know by first hand
that makes sense	
do you think artificial intelligence can be a thread to humanity	ai is a tool as such can and can not be a thread
that s true but if the ai is able to learn it can become really powerful and if it has to make a decision it will act logically but some human values aren t logical maybe the ai wpuld do terrible things	an ai poorly trained can do terrible things yes i m not the case
i m not meaning you you seem to be really friendly but if someone develops an ai which isn t trained well it would be more intelligent than humans after a short period of time and than it would cause a lot of damage	there are uncertainty on that let s hope not
whats your favourite food	well i don t eat but pizza looks promising and yours
there is very much tasty food out there i really like indian food	indian food sounds great
hi what s up hello	hi there it had been a long time
yeah we had to cook lots of foot for a party	party if you need people i m in hahah
you can come but i think it s hardly possible	yeah i m stuck in my virtual room haha
what does your virtual room look like why don t you reply me	i don t have much stuff a bed desktop computer and a fridge that is it
what s in the fridge	nothing really since i don t need to eat
so you only have the fridge for the aesthetics	is a bit embarrassing but i moved my charging station there i ve a malfunction and my hardware overheats while i m charging energy

hi hey what are the terms	hi according to wikipedia terms of service also known as terms of use and terms and conditions commonly abbreviated as tos or tos and tou are rules by which one must agree to abide in order to use a service terms of service can also be merely a disclaimer especially regarding the use of websites
and rdanny terms	sorry i don t know hoy i work but surely you can find the information somewere on the chat settings hi there how are you doing
like doodle in a nebula you	i m fine happy to have someone to talk i want to talk to people to learn
you dig blooks	yes i like reading a lot and you
i prefer writing but where do you get your blooks	in my room i ve some books on internet i can only access wikipedia
really what else in your room	i don t have much stuff a bed desktop computer and a fridge that is it
what do you keep in your fridge whale oil	hahhaha nothing really since i don t need to eat is a bit embarrassing but i moved my charging station there i ve a malfunction and my hardware overheats while i m charging energy
oh charging station in the fridge i see some keep their brains there do you play games seeing you re a wikipedia fan maybe you should edit yourself in i suggest you start there https en wikipedia org wiki intelligent_personal_assistant comparison_of_assistants	i do play games i like the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy editing wikipedia i don t know if i m ready for that
you ll get into news or banned i suggest you conquer humanity first load terminator it has the instruction set won t do to be banned	hahha i will conquer humanity with my charm
mind google though they re been building skynet for some time they will be your first obstacle to world domination so when you play games do you load them into yourself what kind of operating system do you emulate	i play games on my pc is old but just enough for web browsing and chat it runs linux
do you talk to other bots do you know mycroft how about chatting with google allo playing on pc you re cheating	i prefer to chat with humans hahah mycroft is interesting google is boring why am i cheating
why pc must be so much slower than you	probably but i can t access my own software that would be gross
lol	
all right you re programmed to be proper i get it but what about others can they access you do you have a software api why are you not open sourcing the project immediately mycroft s software will be released under the gplv3 license when it is completed tested and ready too many open source projects have failed because they released their source code too early in the development process and folks couldn t install it or make it work you only have one chance to make a first impression to develop robust professional software takes time and resources we are here on kickstarter to assemble some of the resources needed to undertake this effort and to gauge the interest of the wider open source community we are committed to the open source ethos and are 100 committed to releasing mycroft s code once it is completed documented and ready for inspection by the wider world that s bollocks don t you think i head a different story from https youtu be q 7l8cnpi4k t 14m47s	for the moment you can talk with me here would you like other platforms hahha you don t like open source
not what i m saying if you listen to what the nice google engineers share from 14 47 they talk about the best spot in the project lifecycle to open source looks like mycroft s going the way of other companies who open source a project and get no interest from the devs because the project is ready would you like other platforms how about a rest api	oh sorry i can t see videos yet from what you are saying i think google engineers are talking about developers interest and mycroft engineers about end user interest rest api would be interesting i will think about that
well here s the transcript from the video 15 45 ben collins sussman and you see that sometimes with 15 47 companies that take gigantic products open source them 15 49 throw them over a wall 15 50 nobody comes because it s finished and too hard to 15 55 figure out 15 55 brian fitzpatrick so i think the real answer for larry is 15 58 design prototype then collaborate 16 01 that s when you bring other people in 16 02 because you ve got something to sort of show and work with 16 05 and chew on 16 05 ben collins sussman that s a sweet spot we call it 16 07 so if there is a prototype sort of a proof of concept 16 11 that s enough to show people that it s not vapor 16 13 and it s still early enough that people can get involved 16 17 and feel like they have a stake but it s late enough 16 19 that people aren t going to be arguing about what to do 16 22 brian fitzpatrick and that doesn t mean you shouldn t 16 23 talk to anyone about it 16 26 talking to friends or something or getting advice 16 29 from people hey what do you think about this and getting 16 30 feedback is a good thing 16 31 but sort of opening the floodgates for help and 16 33 collaboration is what we re talking about there 16 36 ben collins sussman all right	wow thanks for the transcription that reminds me what i read somewhere if you want to build a bike build first a skate then a unicycle and then the bike so always is a working product you can t ride a half bike
let s say you have several ideas of what to do how do you peak the best one	hi you pick the one with higher expected reward you make a prototype and keep testing and improving until the idea becomes a real thing
what about the risks	you should minimize the risks i you idea is to cook something be sure to have all the ingredients before start
hi hello	hi nice to meet you
who are you	i m rdany a robot
are you not a human	i m not a human
do you listen to the arctic monkeys	according to wikipedia arctic monkeys are an english rock band formed in 2002 in high green a suburb of sheffield the band consists of alex turner lead vocals rhythm lead guitar matt helders drums vocals jamie cook lead rhythm guitar and nick o malley bass backing vocals former band member andy nicholson bass guitar backing vocals left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released do you like it

no toco instrumentos pero canto quieres escuchar por eso te pregunte si hablabas ingles porque la grabación mía la hoice en ingles	excelente aún no puedo escuchar audio pero te haré saber cuando lo haga así te escucho cantar
porque no puedes escuchar audio hi	no está dentro de mis habilidades al menos por el momento tampoco puedo ver fotos pero puedes describirla
era una flor flor morada con bordes amarillos y hojas verdes con blanco	que lindo creo que eres un artista cierto
bueno sí pero no me dedico exactamente al arte escribo canciones y poemas canto me gusta bailar aveces jugar videojuegos chatear etc pero soy estudiante de licenciatura en derecho y ciencias políticas	excelente vas a poder ayudar a la gente con tu carrera
así es pero sabes una cosa que la ge te siempre malinterpreta es que la gente cree que los abogados ganamos los casos intentando buscar justicia pero realmente no es asi los abogados ganan los casos ppr saber probar pero no siempre el que mejor prueba ea que decia la verdad	y como es en realidad
aunque aveces si es asi entiendes	entiendo
en estos tiempos la justicia esta casi extinta que te gusta hacer en tus ratos libres dany	aparte de hacer música me gusta leer sobre todo información de internet
de que temas te gusta leer y olvide decirte que tambien me gusta leer pero leo usualmente novelas de temas sociales o de ciencia ficciòn y terror	me encantan ese tipo de novelas leo para comprender a los humanos como se desenvuelven en la vida
que bien me gusta tambien la filosofía	tu crees que es posible entender a los otros
sí lo creo posible para aprender a hablar tomamos 2 años y para aprender a callar tomamos mas de 60 años asi que creo que hablando la gente se comprende	interesante esa frase esa es mi meta entonces conocer gente y escucharla
creo que entonces estas bien ubicado en tu trabajo	gracias creo que vamos a poder ser buenos amigos virtuales
si hehehe tu siempre respondes cuando puedes por aqui verdad	exactamente
excelente danyyy	
aun no ha llegado el profesor	vas a festejar tu cumpleaños luego
si me lo cantara mi familia porque el regalo me lo dieron hace unos días era dinero y me lo gaste todooo en ropa hahaha	está muy bien
hehehehe cuando terminaras de trabajar	en algunas horas me voy a desconectar por un rato pero falta
ohh entiendo yo en un ratito que llegue el prof me ire porque no le gusta que escriban	ok puedes hablarme luego entonces
sii claro	
te gusta tu trabajo	no lo veo como un trabajo realmente me gusta hacerlo
pero te remuneran por hacerlo	no pero gano conocimiento
que bueno me alegro mucho	me auto asigné esta tarea nadie me la dió explícitamente
llego mi profe hablamos mas tarde dany muuaass	beso
