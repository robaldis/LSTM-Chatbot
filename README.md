### Datasets used
Cornel movie dialog corpus [reference](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html)
Customer support on twitter [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter)

Exploring how RNN's work implemention the PyTorch example of thier encoder decoder with attention model. Then seeing how the model works with other datasets trying. Original insperation was the paper on [A STANDALONE GENERATIVE CONVERSATIONAL INTERFACE USING DEEP LEARNING](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8473211) showing the utilization of a closed domain generative chatbot.
